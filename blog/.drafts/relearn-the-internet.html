In this post I shall be essentially making you relearning the internet. Most of us have been actively using the internet for a decade or longer, not from a position where it is comfortable for us, but from a position where its comfortable for companies to exploit us. Although many guides exist on this matter, I have never found one covering all such aspects in just one big umbrella of reshaping your internet usage patterns for the sake of your own conveninece.
