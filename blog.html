This post was originally made on my blogger blog on 01/04/2022. 

In this post, I shall be expressing my newfound appreciation of Pixel art.

Personally, I have always been a fan of old 90's graphics and retro computing in general. Old 90's graphics, although a compromise made by the artists for the days low graphics memory have in this age become something people appreciate. 

Afterall, it still is an art. And what an art ! Trying to express as much as one can with as less they have is truly a skill. To me this digital art form is the best form of digital art, something that at it's core originated on the computer. No fancy brushes that mimic real life brushes and pens, no artificial realism. It's just pixels !

It's something that can only be properly made with the digital, and can only be properly viewed on it.

Now there are plenty of very good artists who work with digital art, but one thing their art lacks is the true essence of digital. Their art may be hyper realistic, it may be a very humanly art they still do not get as near as pixel art because of one reason, its soul. 


It's art that immediately differentiates itself from other humanly art, neither replicating real life nor looking like something an artist might as well could have made by hand, it gives me a strange blissful yet haunting feeling. Blissful from the marvelous depictions of the world around us, haunting from it's very nature. Its very nature of making one wonder whether they are stuck in the digital. It does not pixel by pixel replicate our world, but mimics it in a way which makes us realize the difference between what lies inside the screen and what lies outside it. 

It's weirdly euphoric in a way too if one might put themselves into the seat of the observer and just watch the pixel world from their eye.

From depictions of urban cityscapes to quiet forests and anything in the middle, pixel art has a diverse range of styles and depictions. And when one thinks this art is a bit lifeless, you have animated pixel art too ! Some of my favorite pixel arts. In no particular order.

Hey there, so now my blog is finally up and running (upto the point where I wanted it to be as of now.) 
Its nothing too fancy, but it does the job hopefully. I will keep updating the blog and will keep adding more to it. Currently I think that a list of the most recent posts on the front page would be something cool to have. 

The blog is techincally just some HTML files that are updated by a small shell script named lb by luke smith (lukesmith.xyz). Its a very simple setup which gets the job done, I keep the blog files on my computer and then when I like to post something new I use the lb shell script to create the new post which then is automatically appended to the blog's files by the lb script. Afterwards I add the edited files to the repository and commit it to the main branch to finally add the changes to my github pages website. I shall now port the contents of my older blog to this new blog on my own website.

Okay from now on I will be using nano as a text editor. And that's pretty much all that I have to say. I fixed a lot of the HTML, copied some more from some more webpages. And now this is actually getting somewhere hopefully.
