        <p>Hello, I am Arjun. This is my webpage. This webpage is entriely written by me in HTML/CSS. It was created with the goal of making a minimalist webpage, without any bloat. My main focus is towards the content that is published in this webpage. I aim to use this webpage to express my thoughts and ideas. I belive it is a much better way to self host your social media's and/or social pages rather than using pre existant services to interact socially on the web.   </p></div>
